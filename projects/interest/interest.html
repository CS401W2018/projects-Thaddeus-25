        <p>I love to play the piano. I have been playing he piano for a long time. Playing the piano not only taught me about music, but also about being patient and discipline. I have never regretted learning to play the piano.</p>
        <p>I play a lot of classical pieces as well as pop music. My most recent song I play is <em>Volodos Turkish March</em>. It is the famous song that we all know <span id="song-name">"Turkish March"</span> but it is arranged by Volodos to be more complicated and beautiful. </p>

            <li class="low-contrast">I chose this color because it is brighter than the normal texts, which makes the text less interesting.</li>
            <li>I chose my colors by searching for color schemes in the internet,and added some of my own by using the color picker.</li>
