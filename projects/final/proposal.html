        <h1>Proposal For Finals</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>1. My project will be about Monster Hunter World, a game by Capcom.</p>
        <p>2. Why I choose this topic is because I love this game and would really like to share this with others.</p>
        <p>3. My homepage will have a picture of the game logo with a general description of the game. Page 1 will have a table of types of weapons used in the game. Page 2 will have the comparison to the updates of the game. Page 3 will be a form that gives me their contact information and in-game profile that allows me to play together with them. Page 4 will be about my favorite monster. page 5 will be about how the game works.</p>
        <p>4. In my form it will ask for the users name, email, time, date, a comment box. My table will contain the type of weapon, amount of variation in-game, and recent data of how many percentage of players use the weapon.</p>
        <p>5. To collect information I will use https://store.steampowered.com/app/582010/Monster_Hunter_World/ (The store that sells the game) and https://monsterhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Monster_Hunter:_World.</p>
        <p>6. Yes, I have read the warnings provided.</p>
