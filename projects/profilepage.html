    <h1>Thaddeus Mak</h1>
    <p>I am from Indonesia. I am currently enrolled at <abbr title="Brigham Young University Hawaii">BYUH</abbr>, majoring in computer science. It has been quite an adventure studying here in BYUH. Learning about about computer is <em>fun!</em></p>

    <p> In my free time, I like to spend it on:</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>Playing video games</li>
        <li>Playing the piano</li>
        <li>Reading novels</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I have been playing the piano for more than 10 years. I play classical pieces as well as pop songs. My favorite song is Hungarian Rhapsody No.2 by Franz Liszt.</p>
